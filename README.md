# Lottery Generator

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple java console program that generates 6 lottery numbers at execution

To ensure that this program executes hassle free execute the following commands from the root directory.

```bash
javac -d bin src/*.java

java -cp bin Lottery

```

Or you can just run the compiled code as there is a class that is already compiled. By running the following command in the root directory.

```bash
java -cp bin Lottery
```

If the ```javac``` command does not work on your CLI you might need set environment variables for your JDK.
